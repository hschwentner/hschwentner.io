## Writing

## Coding and Community

To showcase what I think is beautiful software architecture (and when to use a not-so-beautiful style), whenever I find the time I hack on the [LeasingNinja](https://leasingninja.io).

With a couple of devs from the community, I’m working on [xMolecules](https://xmolecules.org), a library to express architectural concepts and patterns as living documentation in code.

I’m one of the co-organizers of the [CoMoCamp](https://comocamp.org).

## Bio

When people ask me for a short CV, the following is what I write. And here is a high-resolution [profile picture](images/HenningSchwentner251.jpg).

> “Henning loves programming in high quality. He lives this passion as coder, coach, and consultant at WPS – Workplace Solutions. There he helps teams to restructure their monoliths or to build new systems from the beginning with a sustainable architecture. Henning is author of *Domain Storytelling* (Addison-Wesley, 2022), *Domain-Driven Transformation* (dpunkt, 2023), and the LeasingNinja.io.”

## WPS

I'm lucky to work at one of the best companies in the world, [WPS – Workplace Solutions](https://wps.de/en).
It's a team of people that love programming, care about their co-workers and high quality, and are fun to work with.
I'm still amazed they let me play along.
Please see [my page at WPS](https://www.wps.de/hs).

We're always [looking for great new colleagues](https://www.wps.de/en/careers#current-jobs).
